#In this SQL, I am querying a database of multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about populations in different countries around the world. 

#1. What is the average population in a country based on the world population?
SELECT name, 
AVG(population) 
AS avg_population 
FROM countries;

#2. Which countries have an average popualation greater than or equal to 100,000,000?
SELECT name, 
AVG(population) 
AS avg_population 
FROM countries
GROUP BY name 
HAVING avg_population >= 100000000;

#3. Which country has the highest population compared to other countries?
SELECT name, 
MAX(population) 
AS max_population 
FROM countries;

#4. Which country has the lowest population compared to other countries?
SELECT name, 
MIN(population) 
AS min_population 
FROM countries;

#5. What is the total population from all the countries?
SELECT name, 
SUM(population) 
AS sum_population

#6. Which countries have high density and which countries have low density based on their respective populations?
SELECT name, 
CASE WHEN density_per_sq_km > 100 
THEN "high density" 
ELSE "low denisty" 
END "type"
