##In this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert the data into. 
##I then performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#1. Who are the Top 10 artists on Spotify?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#2. What is the average danceability and energy for each artist?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;
